## Aggregate Analysis
### Daily 
The charts below show the daily company incorporations in the UK since January 2020. The lockdown periods correspond to our key dates [timeline](https://uk-firm-dynamics.netlify.app/reports/#timeline).

{{< chart data="dailyagg" >}}

- Business creation increased 8.93% from December 2020 to January 2021. 
- 19,512 additional companies were registered in January 2021 relative to January 2019. 
- Business creation increased 13.46% between January 2020 and January 2021.
- The median daily registrations during lockdown-III is 7.7% lower than during lockdown-I and 21% lower than during lockdown-II.  


### Relative  

Company registrations persistently exceed their 2019 levels. Extensive business activity is observed during the first 2 weeks of January 2021. This might be a persistent trend originating from the last week of December 2020 (see EU-UK TCA outliers). Week 3 onwards, companies registration ratio narrows the gap of 2021/2019 against 2020/2019 over the same weeks. We note the calculations for week 5 2021 contain only two days.

### Country 
The following graph aggregates business creation by country. We separate London from England. In January 2021, firm creation remains higher in all regions than it was in 2019. All countries have extremely high firm creation in the first week of the year; the gap narrows from the second week onwards.

## <i class="fas fa-industry"></i> <span class="ml-1">Sectoral Analysis</span>
### SIC sections
The graph illustrates company registrations in January 2021, January 2020 and January 2019 by industrial sector. We use 2-digit SIC levels (SIC divisions) and group into broader sectors (SIC sections). We use the [ONS classification](https://onsdigital.github.io/dp-classification-tools/standard-industrial-classification/ONS_SIC_hierarchy_view.html) for divisions and sections. We present a selection of notable sectors. 

- January 2021 has higher firm creation in all sectors than January 2019.
- January 2021 has similar firm creation to January 2020. 
- 'Manufacturing', 'Financial and Insurance activities', 'Wholesale, and Retail Trade' sectors present the greatest increase in firm creation. 
- 'Accommodation and Food services' maintain the significant drop observed in December 2020. In fact, this sector is the only one noting less registrations than January 2020. This suggests the strength of lockdown-III in the business activity.
