## In a nutshell 

## <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i>  <span class="ml-1">Highlights</span>
1. Daily business creation increases almost by 9% since last month.
2. 19,512 additional companies registered in January 2021 relative to January 2019.
4. Greater business creation in the first week of January.
5. Manufacturing, financial, retail and wholesale sectors outperform in January 2020 relative to their 2019 levels. Accommodation and Food services sector notice less business registration than in January 2020.

We analyse Companies House ["basic company data"](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html) up to the January 31st, 2021 to understand the effect of COVID-19 policies on business creation, and hence, economic activity. We find that business creation increases by 8.93% since last month. 19,512 additional companies registered in January 2021 relative to January 2019. 13.46% increase in business creation between January 2021 and January 2020. There is more firm creation in every sector, notably in retail, and wholesale sectors. Firm creation continues to increase relative to recent months, but accommodation and food servicesâ€™ performance remains weak.

Business creation increases by 8.93% in January 2021 since last month. 19,512 additional companies registered in January 2021 relative to January 2019. 13.46% increase in business creation between January 2021 and January 2020. 


### Total Effect 

Company registrations persistently exceed their 2019 levels. Extensive business activity is observed during the first 2 weeks of January 2021. This might be a persistent trend originating from the last week of December 2020 (see EU-UK TCA outliers). Week 3 onwards, companies registration ratio narrows the gap of 2021/2019 against 2020/2019 over the same weeks. We note that calculations of week 5 are incomplete given the number of days of data availability (see report on March 2021).

The following graph aggregates the business creation by country. We separate London from England. In January 2021, firm creation remains higher in all regions than it was in 2019. All countries see an extensive firm creation at the beginning of the year; the gap narrows from the second week onwards. Remarkably, little does the new firm registration between the Wales and England differ.

### Zoom in London
London, traditionally, dominates the business activity. In fact, its recovery since lockdown-I occurred earlier. It is interesting, though, to see that the majority of the early-year business creation came mostly from Central and East London. From week 2 onwards, though, only Central London leads the business creation.

## <i class="fas fa-industry"></i> <span class="ml-1">Sectoral Change</span>

The following graph illustrates the cumulative company registrations in January 2021 by industrial sector. For the analysis, we use the 2-digit SIC level and convert it to sectors, following the [ONS classification](https://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/classificationsandstandards/ukstandardindustrialclassificationofeconomicactivities/uksic2007). For illustration purposes, we show only those sectors which present a remarkable change over the years.  

In January 2021, all sectors observe higher firm creation than January 2019. For the majority of the industry, we observe a similar performance between January 2021 and January 2020. Manufacturing, financial and insurance activities, wholesale, and retail trade sectors present the greatest increase in firm creation. Accommodation and food services maintain the significant drop observed in December 2020. In fact, this sector is the only one noting less registrations than January 2020. This suggests the strength of lockdown-III in the business activity.
