## Understanding the EU-UK TCA outliers
There is an outlier of extremely high firm creation on December 30 (and 31), 2020 when the [EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA)]( https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/agreements-reached-between-the-united-kingdom-of-great-britain-and-northern-ireland-and-the-european-union) was signed.

Treating the excess firm registration of the last week as an outlier, we repeat the sectoral analysis, found [here](https://uk-firm-dynamics.netlify.app/reports/jan2021/), *without* considering the activity of the last two days of December. The only noticeable difference regards the administrative and support services whose firm creation on average come behind the arts, entertainment, and recreation sector. 

Looking only at the outliers, manufacturing, administrative and supportive services related businesses seem to register more than the same days in 2019. This static improve might be related to Brexit and the EU-UK TCA.

In terms of the regional analysis, an over-activity is observed in London, England, and Wales.
