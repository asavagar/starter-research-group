## <i class="far fa-calendar-alt   "></i>   COVID-19 Key Dates in the UK

{{< chart data="timeline" >}}


## <i class="fas fa-database  "></i>   Data
The data are constructed from the UK business register, available from [Companies House]( https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house) ([data]( http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html) here in .csv format). The register records every company in the UK with its birth date, post code and industry. This makes it possible to measure daily company registrations.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

The main advantage of the data is that it is timely (almost real-time nature) and covers the entire UK. A disadvantage is that it is not possible to identify companies that will employ and produce compared to those that are set up for accountancy purposes.


We **exclude** firms with missing values on the incorporation date, post code and/or industry of main activity.
