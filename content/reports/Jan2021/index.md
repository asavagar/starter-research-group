## <i class="far fa-lightbulb"></i>  Highlights
1. Daily business creation increases by 18.5 % after the first lockdown.
2. 16.9% more companies incorporations in the second lockdown, relative to the first one.
3. 17,167 additional companies registered on December 2020 than in the equivalent period last year.
4. 2,465, on average, new daily registrations since the first Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.
5. On average terms, retail and wholesale sectors outperform in December 2020 relative to the same period a year ago. Catering's recovery, occurred after the initial lockdown, worsens as certain areas enter the new Tier-4 scheme.

We analyse Companies House ["basic company data"](http://download.companieshouse.gov.uk/en_output.html) up to the December 31st, 2020 to understand the effect of COVID-19 policies on business creation, and hence, economic activity. We find that daily business creation increases by 18.5 % after the first, but before the second, lockdown. 17,167 additional companies registered on December 2020 than in the equivalent period last year. On average terms, retail and wholesale sectors outperform in December 2020 relative to the same period a year ago. Catering's earlier recovery worsens as certain areas enter the new Tier-4 scheme.

The following table summarises the median and the mean of daily new registrations in different periods. The sharp decline of new incorporations, observed during the first lockdown implementation, recovers. The shock of the initial lockdown anticipates over time. Relative to the period before and during the lockdown, registrations increase by 18.5 % and 16.9 %, respectively.
We notice a moderate shock during the second lockdown. The daily median goes from 3057 incorporations during lockdown-II is implemented to 2675 incorporations per day after lockdown-II is implemented, but before lockdown-III. This is a fall in business creation of 1.9 %.
London, South East and East of England move to tier 4 on December 20th, under the [new Tier scheme](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55379220). The data for the latter period concern the last 12 days of December. Daily median business creation shrinks by 7.5 % and 20.8 % relative to the period during the first and second lockdown, respectively. Most of the business creation occurs the last week of 2020 and concerns the manufacturing sector. This over-creation may be related to Brexit and more specifically to the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).
